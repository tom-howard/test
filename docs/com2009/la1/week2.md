title: "Week 2: Odometry & Basic Navigation"  
subtitle: In this session you'll learn how to control a ROS robot's velocity (and thus its position), how to interpret Odometry data and implement some open-loop control nodes.  
---

!!! info
    You should be able to complete the exercises on this page within a two-hour lab session.
    
## Introduction

### Aims

This week you will learn how to control a ROS robot's **position** and **velocity** from both the command line and through ROS Nodes. You will also learn how to interpret the data that allows us to monitor a robot's position in its physical environment.  The things you will learn here form the basis for all robot navigation in ROS, from simple open-loop methods to more advanced closed-loop control (which you will learn more about next week).

### Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Interpret the Odometry data published by a ROS Robot and identify the parts of these messages that are relevant to a 2-wheeled differential drive robot (such as the TurtleBot3).
1. Develop Python nodes to obtain Odometry messages from an active ROS network and *translate* them to provide useful information about a robot's *pose* in a convenient, human-readable way.
1. Implement *open-loop velocity control* of a robot using ROS command-line tools.
1. Develop Python nodes that use open-loop velocity control methods to make a robot follow a pre-defined motion path.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Launch WSL-ROS  
If you haven't done so already, launch your WSL-ROS environment by running the WSL-ROS shortcut in the Windows Start Menu. As you will now know, this may take a couple of minutes, but once it's ready this will open up the Windows Terminal and an *Ubuntu terminal instance* (which we'll refer to as **TERMINAL 1**).

### Step 2: Restore your work  
Remember that any work that you do within the WSL-ROS Environment will not be preserved between sessions or across different University computers.  [At the end of the previous session](../week1/#backup) you should have run the `wsl_ros` tool to back up your home directory to your University U: Drive. Once WSL-ROS is up and running, you should be prompted to restore this:

<figure markdown>
  ![](/images/wsl/restore_prompt.png){width="600"}
</figure>

Enter `Y` to restore your work from last time. You can also restore your work at any time using the following command:

```bash
wsl_ros restore
```

### Step 3: Launch VS Code  
It's also worth launching VS Code now, so that it's ready to go for when you need it later on. [Follow the steps here to launch it correctly](/wsl-ros/vscode/).

### Step 4: Download our ROS Packages

We've put together a few ROS packages of our own, that you'll use throughout this course. These all live inside ["the COM2009 GitHub Repo"](https://github.com/tom-howard/COM2009), and we need to download this into the WSL-ROS environment now, before going any further.

1. In **TERMINAL 1**, navigate to the Catkin Workspace `src` directory using the `cd` command:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
    ```
    ***

1. Then, clone the COM2009 repo from GitHub:


    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tom-howard/COM2009.git
    ```
    ***

1. Once this is done, we need to run `catkin build` to compile everything:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    catkin build
    ```
    ***

1. And finally, we need to re-source our `.bashrc` file:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ***

    !!! warning "Remember"
        If you have any other terminal instances open, then you'll need run `source ~/.bashrc` in these too, in order for the changes made by `catkin build` to propagate through to these as well!
    
That's it for now, we'll start using some of the packages that we've just installed a bit later on...

### Step 5: Launch the Robot Simulation

In **TERMINAL 1** enter the following command to launch a simulation of a TurtleBot3 Waffle in an empty world:  
        
***
**TERMINAL 1:**
```bash
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
```
***

A Gazebo simulation window should open and within this you should see a TurtleBot3 Waffle in empty space:

<figure markdown>
  ![](/images/gazebo/tb3_empty_world.png?width=800px)
</figure>

<p align="center"><strong><em>You're all set up and ready to go!</em></strong></p>

## Position and Velocity

Two types of *Velocity Command* can be issued to any ROS Robot to make it move (and thus change its *position*):

* **Linear** Velocity: The velocity at which the robot moves *forwards* or *backwards* in one of its principal axes.
* **Angular** Velocity: The velocity at which the robot *rotates* about one of its principal axes.

### Principal Axes {#principal-axes}

The motion (i.e. the velocity) of any mobile robot can be defined in terms of *three* principal axes: `X`, `Y` and `Z`. In the context of our TurtleBot3 Waffle, these axes (and the motion about them) are as follows:

<figure markdown>
  ![](/images/waffle/principal_axes.svg?width=20cm)
</figure>

In theory then, a robot can move linearly or angularly about *any* of these three axes, as shown by the arrows in the figure. That's six *Degrees of Freedom* (DOFs) in total, achieved based on a robot's design and the actuators it is equipped with. 

You should hopefully recall from the ["Introducing the Robots" page](/about/robots/#tb3) that our TurtleBot3 Waffles only have two motors though, so they don't actually have six DOFs! These two motors can be controlled independently, which is known as a *"differential drive"* configuration, and ultimately provides it with a total of **two degrees of freedom** in total, as illustrated below.

<figure markdown>
  ![](/images/waffle/velocities.svg?width=20cm)
</figure>

It can therefore only move **linearly** in the **x**-axis (*Forwards/Backwards*) and **angularly** in the **z**-axis (*Yaw*).

It's also worth noting (while we're on the subject of motion) that our TurtleBot3 Waffles have **maximum velocity limits**, which were also defined in the ["Introducing the Robots" page](/about/robots/#tb3).

!!! note "Question"
    What are the maximum velocity limits of our robots?

### ROS Velocity Commands

In the previous session you learnt how to [list all the topics that are currently active on a ROS system](../week1/#rostopic). Open up a new terminal instance now (**TERMINAL 2**) and use what you learnt previously to *list* all the topics that are active on the ROS network now, as a result of launching the Gazebo simulation earlier.

!!! note "Questions"
    1. Which topic in the list do you think could be used to control the velocity of the robot?
    2. Use the `rostopic info` command on the topic to find out more about it.

The topic you identified[^cmd_vel] should use a message of the `geometry_msgs/Twist` type. You'll have to send messages of this type to this topic in order to make the robot move. Use the `rosmsg` command ([as you did in Exercise 4 last week](../week1/#ex4)) to find out more about the format of this message[^rosmsg_info].

[^cmd_vel]: The topic is `/cmd_vel` (i.e. *command velocity*).
[^rosmsg_info]: Answer: `rosmsg info geometry_msgs/Twist`.

You should now be looking at a message format that looks like this: 

    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z

There are **six** parameters that we can assign values to here: `linear.x`, `linear.y`, `linear.z`; and `angular.x`, `angular.y`, `angular.z`. These relate to a robot's *six degrees of freedom* (about its three principal axes), as we discussed above. These topic messages are therefore formatted to give a ROS Programmer the ability to *ask* a robot to move in any one of its six DOFs. 

    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x  <-- Forwards (or Backwards)
      float64 y  <-- Left (or Right)
      float64 z  <-- Up (or Down)
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 x  <-- Roll
      float64 y  <-- Pitch
      float64 z  <-- Yaw

As we also learnt above though, our TurtleBots can only actually move with **linear** velocity in the **x**-axis and **angular** velocity in the **z**-axis. As a result then, only velocity commands issued to the `linear.x` (Forwards/Backwards) or `angular.z` (Yaw) parts of this message will have any effect.

### Robot Odometry

Another topic that should have appeared when you ran `rostopic list` earlier is `/odom`. This topic contains *Odometry data*, which is also essential for robot navigation and is a basic feedback signal, allowing a robot to approximate its location.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 1: Exploring Odometry Data {#ex1}

1. In **TERMINAL 2** use the `rostopic echo` command to display the odometry data currently being published by our simulated robot:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    rostopic echo -c /odom
    ```
    ***

    Expand the terminal window as necessary so that you can see the whole topic message (it starts with `header` and ends with `---`).
    
    !!! note "Question"
        What does the `-c` option in the command above actually do?
    
1. Now, you need to launch a new Windows Terminal instance so that you can view it side-by-side with **TERMINAL 2**. To do this, press the "New Tab" button whilst pressing the `Shift` key. We'll call this one **TERMINAL 3**. Arrange both windows side-by-side, so you can see what's happening in both, simultaneously.

1. In **TERMINAL 3** launch the `turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` node [as you did last week](../week1/#ex1): <a name="teleop"></a>

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
    ```
    ***

1. In **TERMINAL 3** enter `A` a couple of times to make the robot rotate on the spot.  Observe how the odometry data changes in **TERMINAL 2**.  Is there anything in the `twist` part of the `/odom` message that corresponds to the `angular vel` that you are setting in **TERMINAL 3**? 
1. Now press the `S` key to halt the robot, then press `W` a couple of times to make the robot drive forwards.  How does the `twist` part of the message now correspond to the `linear vel` setting in **TERMINAL 3**?
1. Now press `D` a couple of times and your robot should start to move in a circle.  What linear and angular velocities are you requesting in **TERMINAL 3**, and how are these represented in the `twist` part of the `/odom` message?  What about the `pose` part of the message?  How is this data changing as your robot moves in a circular path.
    
    !!! note "Question"
        What do you think `twist` and `pose` are actually telling us?
    
1. Press `S` in **TERMINAL 3** to stop the robot (but leave the `turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` node running).  Then, press `Ctrl+C` in **TERMINAL 2** to shut down the `rostopic echo` process. 

1. Let's look at the `pose` part of the `Odometry` message in more detail now. With the robot stationary, use `rosrun` to run a Python node that we have created to help illustrate how this relates to the robot's position and orientation in its environment: 

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    rosrun tuos_ros_examples robot_pose.py
    ```
    ***
        
1. Now (using the `turtlebot3_teleop_key` node in **TERMINAL 3**), drive your robot around again, keeping an eye on the outputs that are being printed by the `robot_pose.py` node in **TERMINAL 2** as you do so.

    The output of the `robot_pose.py` node shows you how the robot's *position* and *orientation* (i.e. *"pose"*) are changing in real-time as you move the robot around. The `"initial"` column tells us the robot's pose when the node was first launched, and the `"current"` column show us what its pose currently is. The `"delta"` column then shows the difference between the two.
    
    !!! note "Question"
        Which pose parameters *haven't* changed, and is this what you would expect (considering [the robot's principal axes, as illustrated above](#principal-axes))?
    
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in **TERMINAL 2** and **TERMINAL 3**, to stop the `robot_pose.py` and `turtlebot3_teleop` nodes.  Then, close down **TERMINAL 3** so that only one Windows Terminal application remains open with 2 active tabs: **TERMINAL 1** and **TERMINAL 2**.

### What is Odometry? {#odometry}

We can learn more about Odometry data by using the `rostopic info` command:

***
**TERMINAL 2:**
```bash
rostopic info /odom
```
***

This provides information about the *type* of message used by this topic:

    Type: nav_msgs/Odometry  

We can find out more about this using the `rosmsg info` command:

***
**TERMINAL 2:**
```bash
rosmsg info nav_msgs/Odometry
```
***

Which tells us that the `nav_msgs/Odometry` message contains four *base* elements:

1. header
1. child_frame_id
1. pose
1. twist

#### Pose

**Pose** tells us the *position* and *orientation* of the robot relative to an arbitrary reference point (typically where the robot was when it was turned on). The pose is determined from:

* Data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the OpenCR board,
* Data from both the left and right wheel encoders,
* An *estimation* of the distance travelled by the robot from its pre-defined reference point (using dead-reckoning).

*Position* data is important for determining the movement of our robot, and from this we can estimate its location in 3-dimensional space.

<a name="euler_angs"></a>*Orientation* is expressed in units of [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion), and needs to be converted into Euler angles (in radians) about the principal axes. Fortunately, there are functions within the ROS `tf` library to do that for us, which we can use in any Python node as follows:

```python
from tf.transformations import euler_from_quaternion

(roll, pitch, yaw) = euler_from_quaternion([orientation.x, 
                     orientation.y, orientation.z, orientation.w], 
                     'sxyz')
```

Our TurtleBot3 can only move in a 2D plane and so, actually, its pose can be fully represented by 3 parameters: <code>(x,y,&theta;<sub>z</sub>)</code>, where `x` and `y` are the 2D coordinates of the robot in the `X-Y` plane, and <code>&theta;<sub>z</sub></code> is the angle of the robot about the `z` (*yaw*) axis.

!!! note "Question"
    In the previous exercise, did you notice how the `linear_z`, `theta_x` and `theta_y` values in the `delta` column all remained at `0.000`, even when the robot was moving around?

#### Twist

**Twist** tells us the current linear and angular velocities of the robot, and this data comes directly from the wheel encoders.

Once again, all of this data is defined in terms of the principal axes, as illustrated in [the figure above](#principal-axes).

#### :material-pen: Exercise 2: Creating a Python node to process Odometry data {#ex2}

In the previous session you learnt how to create a package and build simple nodes in Python to publish and subscribe to messages on a topic. In this exercise you will build a new subscriber node, much like you did in the previous session, but this one will subscribe to the `/odom` topic that we've been talking about above. You'll also create a new package called `week2_navigation` for this node to live in!

1. Create a package [in the same way as last week](../week1/#ex5), this time called `week2_navigation`, which depends on the `rospy`, `nav_msgs` and `geometry_msgs` libraries. Use the `catkin_create_pkg` tool as you did last week. Remember to ensure that you are located in the `~/catkin_ws/src/` directory before you do this though:
     
    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
    ```
    Then:
    ```bash
    catkin_create_pkg {BLANK}
    ```
    ***

    !!! warning "Fill in the Blank!"
        Recall how we used the `catkin_create_pkg` tool [last week](../week1/#ex5), but adapt this now for the `week2_navigation` package, as detailed above.
    
1. Run `catkin build` on this:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    catkin build week2_navigation
    ```
    and then re-source your environment:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ***

1. The subscriber that we will build here will be structured in much the same way as [the subscriber that we built last time](../week1/subscriber). The difference now though is that this one will subscribe to the `/odom` topic (instead of `"chatter"`), and its callback function will therefore receive `Odometry` type messages (instead of `String`), so we'll have to deal with those a bit differently. We've created a template for this to help you to get started. Download this into the `src` directory of your new `week2_navigation` package now:
    
    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**

    1. Step 1: navigate to the `src` directory of your `week2_navigation` package:
        ```bash
        cd ~/catkin_ws/src/week2_navigation/src/
        ```
    1. Then download the template code from GitHub:
        ```bash
        wget -O odom_subscriber.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tom-howard/COM2009/main/tuos_ros_examples/src/odom_subscriber_template.py
        ```
    1. Finally, make this executable using `chmod`:
        ```bash
        chmod +x odom_subscriber.py
        ```
    ***

1. Run this as it is to see what happens to begin with:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    rosrun week2_navigation odom_subscriber.py
    ```
    ***

    ... Hmmm, something's wrong here isn't it!? You may have seen the following error:

    ```txt
    /usr/bin/env: ‘python3\r’: Permission denied
    ```

    The clue here is the `python3\r` (specifically the `\r` bit). This is a *Windows line ending*... 
    
    Text files (including things like Python scripts) created on Windows use different line endings (i.e. the characters that signify the end of each line of text) to those created on Linux. Windows uses a "carriage return" *and* a "line feed" (`\r\n`) at the end of each line, but Linux uses just a "line feed" (`\n`)[^source]. Because we're working within a Linux environment here (Ubuntu), we must make sure we're using Linux line endings at all times! We can change this easily from inside VS Code... 
    
    [^source]: Adapted from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/csc209h/tut/line-endings.html

    1. In the VS Code File Explorer navigate to the `~/catkin_ws/src/week2_navigation/src` folder and open the `odom_subscriber.py` file.
    1. In the blue bar along the bottom of the VS Code screen (towards the bottom right-hand corner) you should see the text `CRLF`. Click on this and a menu should then appear at the top of the screen with the text `"Select End of Line Sequence"`.
    1. Select the `LF` option in this menu, then save the file.

    ![](/images/vscode/switch_line_ending.png?width=800px) 

1. OK, the file should run now, so launch it (using `rosrun` again) and see what it does.

1. Have a think about what's different between this and [the subscriber from last time](../week1/subscriber)...
    
    In the Week 1 Subscriber we were working with a `String` type message from the `std_msgs` package, whereas this time we're using an `Odometry` message from the `nav_msgs` package instead - notice how the imports and the callback function have changed as a result of this.

1. You need to add some additional code to the callback function now: 
    1. The node needs to print the robot's real-time odometry data to the terminal in the form: <code>(x,y,&#952;<sub>z</sub>)</code>.
    1. The format of the message has already been structured for you, but you need to add in the relevant variables that represent the correct elements of the robot's real-time pose.
    1. You'll need to use the `euler_from_quaternion` function from the `tf.transformations` library to convert the raw orientation values from Quaternions into Radians. If you need a hint, why not have a look back [at this bit from earlier](#euler_angs), or at the source code for the `robot_pose.py` node that we launched from the `tuos_ros_examples` package in the [previous exercise](#ex1). 

1. Launch your node using `rosrun` and observe how the output (the formatted odometry data) changes whilst you move the robot around again using the `turtlebot3_teleop` node in a new terminal instance (**TERMINAL 3**).
1. Stop your `odom_subscriber.py` node in **TERMINAL 2** and the `turtlebot3_teleop` node in **TERMINAL 3** by entering `Ctrl+C` in each of the terminals.

## Basic Navigation: Open-loop Velocity Control

#### :material-pen: Exercise 3: Moving a Robot with `rostopic` in the Terminal {#ex3}

!!! warning
    Make sure that you've stopped the `turtlebot3_teleop` node running in **TERMINAL 3** (by entering `Ctrl+C`) before starting this exercise.

<a name="rostopic_pub"></a>We can use the `rostopic pub` command to *publish* data to a topic from a terminal by using the command in the following way:

```bash
rostopic pub {topic_name} {message_type} {data}
```

As we discovered earlier, the `/cmd_vel` topic is expecting *linear* and *angular* data, each with an `x`, `y` and `z` component. We can get further help with formatting this message by using the autocomplete functionality within the terminal. *Type* the following into **TERMINAL 3** hitting the `Space` and `Tab` keys on your keyboard where indicated:

***
**TERMINAL 3:**
```bash
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist[SPACE][TAB]
```

The full message should then be presented to us:

    rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0
    angular:
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.0"

***

1. Scroll back through the message using the &larr; key on your keyboard and then edit the values of the various parameters, as appropriate. First, define some values that would make the robot *rotate on the spot*.  **Make a note of the command that you used**.
1. Enter `Ctrl+C` in **TERMINAL 3** to stop the message from being published.
1. Next, enter a command in **TERMINAL 3** to make the robot *move in a circle*.  **Again, make a note of the command that you used**.
1. Enter `Ctrl+C` in **TERMINAL 3** to again stop the message from being published.
1. Finally, enter a command to *stop* the TurtleBot3 **and make a note of this too**.
1. Enter `Ctrl+C` in **TERMINAL 3** to stop this final message from being published.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 4: Creating a Python node to make the robot move {#ex4}

You will now create another node to control the motion of your TurtleBot3 by publishing messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic. You created a publisher node in Week 1, and you can use this as a starting point.

1. In **TERMINAL 2**, ensure that you are still located within the `src` folder of your `week2_navigation` package. You could use `pwd` to check your current working directory, where the output should look like this:

        /home/student/catkin_ws/src/week2_navigation/src  

    If you aren't located here then navigate to this directory using `cd`.

1. Create a new file called `move_circle.py`:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 2:**
    ```bash
    touch move_circle.py
    ```
    ... and make this file executable using the `chmod` command.
    ***

1. Open up this file in VS Code, then copy and paste the contents of [the publisher node from last week](../week1/publisher) into the new `move_circle.py` file to get you started. Then edit the code to achieve the following:
    * Make your TurtleBot3 move in a circle with a path radius of approximately 0.5m.
    * Your Python node needs to publish `Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic in order to make the TurtleBot3 move. [See below for further detail on this](#twist-py).
    * Remember that our robots have a maximum linear velocity (`linear.x`) of 0.26 m/s, and a maximum angular velocity (`angular.z`) of 1.82 rad/s. 
    * Make sure that you code your `shutdownhook()` correctly so that the robot stops moving when the node is shutdown (via `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that launched it).

**Advanced feature:**

1. Create a launch file to launch this *and* your `odom_subscriber.py` node simultaneously with a single `roslaunch` command. Refer to the launch file that you created [last week](../week1/#ex8) for a reminder on how to do this.

### Publishing `Twist` messages in Python {#twist-py}

From [last week's publisher exercise](../week1/#ex6), we know how to publish a `String` type message to a topic in Python, but how do we apply the same principles to a `Twist` message (on the `/cmd_vel` topic)? Let's have a look at this... 

First, you need to import the `rospy` library, as well as the `Twist` message type from the `geometry_msgs` library:

```python
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
```

Then, create an instance of a `rospy.Publisher()` and assign it to an object called `pub`. When we create the object we tell the `Publisher()` method which topic we want to publish this message to (via the first input argument), and also that we will be publishing a message of the `Twist` type (the second input argument):

```python
pub = rospy.Publisher({topic name}, Twist, queue_size=10) # a queue size of 10 usually works!
```

Then we need to create a `Twist()` message instance and assign it to an object (which we'll call `vel_cmd`):

```python
vel_cmd = Twist()
```

We know from earlier that the `geometry_msgs/Twist` message has the format:

    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z

We also know, that only velocity commands issued to the following two parameters will actually have any effect on the velocity of our robot:

    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x

...and:

    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 z

As such, we set appropriate velocity values to these attributes of the `Twist()` message (assigned to `vel_cmd`):

```python
vel_cmd.linear.x = 0.0 # m/s
vel_cmd.angular.z = 0.0 # rad/s
```

We can then publish this to the relevant topic on the ROS network by supplying it to the `rospy.Publisher().publish()` method (which we instantiated as `pub` earlier):

```python
pub.publish(vel_cmd)
```

Use these pointers when working on your `move_circle.py` node!

## Wrapping Up

In this session you have learnt how to control the velocity and position of a robot from both the command-line (using ROS command-line tools) and from ROS Nodes by publishing correctly formatted messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic.  

You have also learnt about *Odometry*, which is published by our robot to the `/odom` topic.  The odometry data tells us the current linear and angular velocities of our robot in relation to its 3 principal axes.  In addition to this though, it also tells us where in physical space our robot is located and oriented, which is determined based on *dead-reckoning*.  We'll talk more about dead-reckoning later on in the COM2009 lecture course, but for now though consider the following (based on what we've covered in this lab session): 

* If odometry is derived from dead-reckoning, what information (sensor/actuator data) is used to do this?
* Do you see any potential limitations of this?
* Can a control method that uses odometry as a feedback signal be considered *closed-loop control?* 

We'll explore this a little more next week, but you might want to consider reading Chapter 11.1.3 ("Pose of Robot") in the ROS Robot Programming eBook that we mentioned [here](/about/robots/#ebook).

### Saving your work {#backup}

Remember, the work you have done in the WSL-ROS environment during this session **will not be preserved** for future sessions or across different University machines automatically! To save the work you have done here today you should now run the following script in any idle WSL-ROS Terminal Instance:

```bash
wsl_ros backup
```

This will export your home directory to your University U: Drive, allowing you to restore it at the start of the next session.
