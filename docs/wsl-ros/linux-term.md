# A Quick Introduction to the Linux Terminal

As explained earlier, you'll be working extensively with the Linux Terminal throughout this lab course. An *idle* WSL-ROS terminal instance will look like this:

Here, the presence of the `$` symbol indicates that the terminal is ready to accept a command. Text before the `$` symbol has two parts separated by the `:` symbol:

* Text to the **left** of the `:` tells us the name of the Linux user ("student" in this case) followed by the WSL-ROS version that you are working with.
* Text to the **right** of the `:` tells us where in the Linux Filesystem we are currently located (`~` means *"The Home Directory"*, which is an alias for the path: `/home/student/`).

If you don't see the `$` symbol at all, then this means that a process is currently running. To stop any running process enter `Ctrl+C` simultaneously on your keyboard.
