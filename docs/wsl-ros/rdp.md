# Accessing WSL-ROS Remotely

WSL-ROS is also available remotely on some University machines via the [University Remote Desktop Service](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/computer-facilities/university-computers).

!!! note
    You'll need to use your university account credentials to access this service and will also need to [have multifactor authentication (MFA) set up on your university account](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/mfa/setting-up-mfa).

1. The environment has been installed on all the machines in [Virtual Classroom 1](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/findapc/rdp/room/49/pcs) (University of Sheffield sign-in required).
1.  From here, you should see a long list of PCs. Any that have a blue "Connect" button next to them are available to use.
1.  Click on the "Connect" button next to an available machine.  This will download a `.rdp` file to your computer.
1.  Once downloaded, double-click on the `.rdp` file and log in to the PC using your university account credentials. (*Look out for an MFA notification on your MFA-linked device.*)
1. Once you're logged into the remote machine follow the steps in the [Launching WSL Section](../first-run) to launch the environment. 
1. When you're finished, close the RDP connection and then close the Remote Desktop app on your machine.

!!! tip
    Only the computers in **Virtual Classroom 1** have the WSL-ROS environment installed, so make sure you only use this room if you want to work on this remotely.
